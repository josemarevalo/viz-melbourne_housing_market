# Melbourne's Housing Market Dashboard

This Data Visualisation project analyses a dataset with more than 34k real estate property listings. I used Tableau to create a dashboard that helps users to find their optimum suburb to buy a house in. This project clearly shows how the suburbâ€™s medium price depends highly on the distance to the city centre and the number of the property's bedrooms.
